# sentencemaker
HEY YALL!

Sentencemaker is a c++ terminal program that converts your words into sentences! Maybe I'll stretch this out into like a letter-by-letter word gen tool, but for now, this is all it will be. Check the releases, and don't look at the buggy mess that is my c sentencemaker 1.4 stuff.
